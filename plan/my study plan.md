## I asked ChatGPT to give me a study plan to become a data scientist

I asked ChatGPT to give me a study plan to become a self-taught employable data scientist. I gave it prompts including the fact that I have 6 hours a day, 5 days a week to study. I am quiet comfortable with Excel. I want to be employable in 3-4 months.
