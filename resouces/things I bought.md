## These are a few of my favourite things

... to get me started to become a self-taught data scientist

1. A new chairü™ë

    Since the last of my corporate role, my boyfriend stole my nice chair for his home office and I was left with a broken chair that will raise health and safety concern within 1 minute of sitting down. To be able to spend a whole day in front of a computer to learn about a new subject, I needed a new chair to set me up right for my new adventure. Now that the chair is here, my cat has claimed it as hers and it's covered in cat hair. 


2. A Notebooküìñ

    Not any notebook, a nice notebook. I came across this Harry Potter notebooks by Moleskine and fell in love with the design. I got the "Expecto Patronum" version. It certainly gives me the magical power to study harder to become a data wizard!


3. Online exerciseüßÆ

   I wasn't planning on paying for any online resources to begin with because there are so many free resources available. However, as I started to practise typing out codes and working on questions, I feel like I need more challenging questions to help me practise using the codes in different ways. Therefore, I bought an online course for US$35 which includes many questions that comes with answers and explanations to help me get better at learning Python. https://www.lukebarousse.com/python 


4. Pastryü•ê

   You may say how does a pastry have anything to do with learning data science? It doesn't really. BUT we all need a little reward from time to time when we completed certain milestones. I bought myself a pastry for completing the first week of learning, adhering to my study goals and continuing on this journey. It's called celebrating the small wins and I intend to continue doing this throughout my learning. So more pastry to come!
