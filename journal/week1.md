# Week 1 - Week of 17 Feb 2025

What was the study goal?
- Learning the basics of Python, get used to using Jupyter Notebook, setting up Github account

What did I learn?
- The various data types in Python, the basic syntax of Python, Using a Google Colab to document my codes and notes
- Using basic functions of Github

What resources did I use?
- The course I am following is done by Luke Barousse. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUSDVGivd-8 In the first week, I finished the video up to the chapter on "Classes".
- I also paid for the course problems by Luke Barousse so I have more questions to practise everything I learnt. The course was US$35.
- I started with this playlist as suggested by ChatGPT. https://youtu.be/YYXdXT2l-Gg?si=X-HDw-9gU7itT6HN However, I find there is a lack of additional problems that I can practise solving after the videos so I opted for Luke Barousse's video which comes with more specific data science needs, practical exercises and more updated resources. 

What did I find difficult?
- List Comprehension.
- Trusing that the resources I am using are good enough. 

How did I overcome the difficulties?
-  It took me a while to understand the logic behind the syntax for list comprehension. I watched several other youtube videos that explain what list comprehension is.
-  I will look for more practice questions to test out the knowledge I aquired this week to see if I need to learn more of any specific topics

Anything changed from the study plan?
- The study plan originally called to make me build a simple python calculator but I still need to learn how to ask for input from users so that's something I need to learn next.
- Instead of using an official Jupyter Notebook, I am using Google Colab instead. 

How long did I take to achieve the study goal for the week?
- A lot of this week was setting up the environment for me to start learning Python. Pretty much the whole of day 1 was used for setting up my account and looking for the right video.
- As for learning the basic syntax of Python and writing out my own codes for the practice questions, it took around 3-3.5 days.

What other things did I do this week?
- I started this Github page which took me a good half day to figure out how to organise everything.
- I also got ill towards the end of week 1 and couldn't study at all until end of the original week 2. Therefore, this week is the results of 2 weeks combined.
