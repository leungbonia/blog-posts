# Week 8 - Week of 14 April 2025

What was the study goal?
- SQL Advanced

What did I learn?
- More advanced SQL codes such as `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `JOIN`, `CASE`, and subqueries

What resources did I use?
- I bought the SQL course on https://www.analystbuilder.com/ . It was Â£35.82. 

What did I find difficult?
- Since I started learning about data science using Python, it took me a bit of time to get used to a different syntax. 

How did I overcome the difficulties?
- more practise. 

Anything changed from the study plan?
- I was a bit slow on my study this week. I need to extend phase 2 of my study for an extra week before I get into phase 3. I am giving myself a to-do list at the start of the week to complete so I do not procrastinate.  

How long did I take to achieve the study goal for the week?
- I procrastinated a bit and only spent 1 day on studying SQL this week. However, the knowledge can be acquired comfortably within 3-4 days.  

What other things did I do this week?
- I took up a part-time job which took away 2 days of last week for me to study.
- Also, it was bank holiday and I did not study on those days.
