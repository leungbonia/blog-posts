# Week 6 - Week of 31 May 2025

What was the study goal?
- Statistics for Data Science

What did I learn?
- Basically a recap of statistics I learnt at university
- How boring I find statistics...

What resources did I use?
- Last week I used the freecodecamp video on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxpc-HPKN28
- However, I find the knowledge shared in the video was too introductory. I did not get to learn about more in-depth statistic knowledge. Therefore, I started watching the DATAtab video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9teElePNkk
- The DATAtab video gave a more in-depth look into statistics and the various tests can be done to perform different statistical analyses.

What did I find difficult?
- Staying awake watching a video that talks about statistics.

How did I overcome the difficulties?
-  I sped up the video to try to absorb as much as possible when I am awak.

Anything changed from the study plan?
- I added resources to my learning on statistics. 

How long did I take to achieve the study goal for the week?
- 1 day.  

What other things did I do this week?
- I shared the first project on LinkedIn using a carousel.
- Started exploring different datasets available online that may spark my interests in making some visualisations.
