# Week 4 - Week of 14 Mar 2025

What was the study goal?
- Advanced data visualisation and Completing a project

What did I learn?
- Use Git within VS code to sync with my own GitHub
- structure a project from start to finish

What resources did I use?
- I completed the course by Luke Barousse. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUSDVGivd-8
- I also explored Kaggle for different datasets that I can use for my own project. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ngshiheng/michelin-guide-restaurants-2021

What did I find difficult?
- Writing my own functions to perform repeitive tasks.

How did I overcome the difficulties?
-  Use ChatGPT to help with writing the codes and tweak as needed. 

Anything changed from the study plan?
- The study plan called for using ```sns.heatmap()``` and ```.corr()``` to perform data analysis and visualisation. However the course by Luke Barousse did not cover these topics. I still need to find database to use practise using these codes.
- I did not finish writing up the project README towards the end of the week. However, majority of the analyses were completed. It was the write up that took more time than I anticipated. 

How long did I take to achieve the study goal for the week?
- It took me around 1.5 days to complete the rest of the course with Luke Barousse.
- Around 3 days were used to find the right dataset, start data analyses and visualisation and start writing up the project README. 

What other things did I do this week?
- I shared on my Linkedin I completed the Luke Barousse course.
