# Week 2 - Week of 3 Mar 2025

*Note: I was so sick in the week of 24 Feb 2025 that I could not leave my bed and do any studying. Hence, I skipped a calendar week in my study.*

What was the study goal?
- Working with data using Pandas, simple data visualisation

What did I learn?
- Using NumPy and Pandas to process data
- Using Matplotlib to perform simple data visualisation

What resources did I use?
- The course I am following is done by Luke Barousse. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUSDVGivd-8
- In this week, I finished the video up to the 7:04:50 on "Exercise: Job Demand".

What did I find difficult?
- The syntax for dataframe, particularly when to use ( ), [ ], and { }. 

How did I overcome the difficulties?
-  Still in the process of understanding when to use which bracket. 

Anything changed from the study plan?
- I have yet to use Seaborn which was planned in last week. However, I think I should be able to start studying about Seaborn as it is included towards the end of the course provided  by Luke Barousse.

How long did I take to achieve the study goal for the week?
- It took me around 2 days to complete the basic materials for Pandas and data visualisation using Matplotlib. 

What other things did I do this week?
- I shared on my Linkedin that I started studying to become a data scientist. The support was overwhelming. It gave me more confidence to share more about my study in the future.
