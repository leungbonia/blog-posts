# Week 3 - Week of 10 Mar 2025

What was the study goal?
- Data manipulation & analysis

What did I learn?
- More advanced codes to analyse data using Pandas
- Getting comfortable with performing analyses on dataframes
- More advanced codes to custommise data visualisation
- Using Seaborn to perform data visualisation

What resources did I use?
- The course I am following is done by Luke Barousse. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUSDVGivd-8
- In this week, I finished the video up to the 9:31:39 "Seaborn: Intro".

What did I find difficult?
- Getting used to the syntax of Matplotlib and Seaborn.

How did I overcome the difficulties?
-  Using ChatGPT to help with identifying the errors and solutions for codes. 

Anything changed from the study plan?
- The study plan called for using ```sns.heatmap()``` and ```.corr()``` to perform data analysis and visualisation. However the course by Luke Barousse did not cover these topics. I will study these codes this week using other resources. 

How long did I take to achieve the study goal for the week?
- It took me around 3.5 days to complete the advanced materials on Pandas, Matplotlib and introduction on Seaborn. 

What other things did I do this week?
- I shared on my Linkedin the study plan that ChatGPT generated for me. There were people who gave me constructive feedback on the study plan.
