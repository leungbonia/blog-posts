# Week 5 - Week of 21 Mar 2025

What was the study goal?
- Statistics for Data Science

What did I learn?
- Not much because the I find statistics really boring and I struggle to finish the video.
- A lot of the content in the video I used was actually taught at my university course from 10 years ago. They are mainly definitions of jargons within statistics. 

What resources did I use?
- I used the freecodecamp video on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxpc-HPKN28

What did I find difficult?
- Just concentrating on the video because I found it so boring. 

How did I overcome the difficulties?
-  I gave myself a break and decided to slow my study plan down and complete the statistics chapter in the next week.
-  I still have time and am on progress with the study plan. 

Anything changed from the study plan?
- It took me longer than expected to complete the write up of my first project - An Analysis of the Michelin Restaurants. I took the first 2 days of this week to complete the write up.
- I did not finish the video I was set out to finish. I will continue to finish the video. In addition, I will dedicate more time next week to perform statistical analyses using the knowledge acquired from the video. 

How long did I take to achieve the study goal for the week?
- 1 day and counting.  

What other things did I do this week?
- Nothing.
- I am excited to start learning SQL in the week after!
