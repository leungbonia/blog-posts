# Week 9 - Week of 28 April 2025

What was the study goal?
- SQL Advanced

What did I learn?
- Creating projects using SQL

What resources did I use?
- I bought the SQL course on https://www.analystbuilder.com/ . It was Â£35.82. 

What did I find difficult?
- Not much really. Just getting used to the syntax. 

How did I overcome the difficulties?
- More practise. 

Anything changed from the study plan?
- I was a bit slow on my study last week. It took me 3 weeks to complete the SQL phase of my study. However, it only took me net 3 full days of studying to complete the material simply because I was procrastinating. 

How long did I take to achieve the study goal for the week?
- The knowledge can be acquired comfortably within 3-4 days.  

What other things did I do this week?
- I spent more time doing my social media rather than using my time to study. Hopefully when I start Phase 3 of my study, I can spare more time for studying.
