# This is how I become a data scientist 
This blog documents the 5Ws and 1H of my journey of becoming a data scientist:

👩🏽 Who: Who am I? Who do I want to become when I am a qualified data scientist?

🔍 What: What tools am I using to help me learn? What obstacles do I face along the way?

🌆 Where: Where do I want to work after this? Where do I plan to ustilise my skills once I finish this study?

⌚ When: When do I plan to use my skills? When will I realise my 5 or 10 -year plan?

🔮 Why: Why am I doing this? Why the career change?

💻 How: How am I scheduling my day? How will my previous experience help/ hinder this career change?


There are many questions to be answered. 

You are more than welcome to ask me any questions along the way. Most importantly, please give me any suggestions and advice on my journey. I am completely new to this and any guidance is appreciated.
